// Write a function called generatePassword that takes three parameters: length, includeNumbers, and includeSpecialChars. The function should generate a random password of the given length. If the user doesn't specify whether to include numbers or special characters, the function should default to including them.

// includeNumbers is a boolean that indicates whether to include numbers in the password. Default to true.
// includeSpecialChars is a boolean that indicates whether to include special characters. Default to false.
